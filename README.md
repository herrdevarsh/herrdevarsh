# Hi, I'm Devarsh 👋  

I'm a Data Analyst / Junior Data Engineer based in Germany with an M.Sc. in Data Science.  
I sit between analytics and engineering: I move data from messy sources into reliable models and turn them into dashboards or ML use cases that people actually use.

## For recruiters – 2-minute tour

If you only have a couple of minutes, start here 👇

1. **[GDPR-Compliant Real-Time Analytics Platform](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/gdpr-realtime-analytics-platform)**  
   Kafka + PostgreSQL + Docker. Streaming + batch (lambda-style), GDPR-compliant data model, “right to be forgotten” workflow and business + audit reports.  
   ➜ Shows how I think about **real-time data, privacy, architecture and operations**.

2. **[E-commerce Data Pipeline](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/ecommerce-data-pipeline)**  
   Pure batch data engineering: CSV ingestion → pandas transformations → star schema in SQLite → analytics queries + reports. Includes tests, logging and CI with GitHub Actions.  
   ➜ Shows that I can build **clean, tested batch pipelines and BI-ready models**.

3. **[Germany Energy Analytics Platform](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/germany-energy-analytics-platform)**  
   End-to-end analytics on German energy/public data with time-series-style analysis and dashboards.  
   ➜ Shows my **BI, visualization and analytical storytelling** skills.

4. **[Heart Disease Prediction (M.Sc. Thesis)](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/heart-disease-prediction-thesis)**  
   Full ML pipeline on clinical data: EDA, feature engineering, model comparison (ML + deep learning) and explainable AI (SHAP, LIME). Includes an “At a glance (for reviewers/recruiters)” section.  
   ➜ Shows that I can deliver **serious ML + XAI end-to-end**, not just toy notebooks.

Each repo README explains:
- the **business / use case**
- the **architecture / approach**
- the **tech stack**
- how to **run it locally**

## Tech stack & certifications

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Data / Engineering:** pandas, SQLAlchemy, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions  
- **BI / Analytics:** Power BI, Plotly / Dash, time-series & statistical analysis  
- **ML:** scikit-learn, basic deep learning, XAI (SHAP, LIME)

## A bit of background

Before moving to Germany, I ranked in roughly the top 1.5% and 0.5% of ~1.5M candidates in India’s national engineering entrance exam (JEE Advanced).  
It didn’t make me a genius, but it did teach me to **prepare hard, stay calm under pressure and keep competing** – the same mindset I bring to data work.

---

## What I'm looking for

Roles where I can combine:

- building and operating **data pipelines**  
- creating **dashboards / reports** that drive real decisions  
- and, where it makes sense, adding **ML / AI** on top of solid data foundations.
