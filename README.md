# Hi, I'm Devarsh 👋

I'm a Data Analyst / Junior Data Engineer based in Germany with an M.Sc. in Data Science.  
I sit between analytics and engineering: I move data from messy sources into reliable models and turn them into dashboards or ML use cases that people actually use.

## For recruiters – 2-minute tour

If you only have a couple of minutes, start here:

1. **[GDPR-Compliant Real-Time Analytics Platform](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/gdpr-realtime-analytics-platform)**  
   Kafka + PostgreSQL + Docker. Streaming + batch (lambda-style), GDPR-compliant data model, “right to be forgotten” workflow, and business + audit reports. Shows how I think about real-time analytics, privacy and production-like systems.

2. **[E-commerce Data Pipeline](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/ecommerce-data-pipeline)**  
   Pure batch data engineering: CSV ingestion → pandas transformations → star schema in SQLite → analytics queries + reports. Includes tests, logging and CI with GitHub Actions.

3. **[Germany Energy Analytics Platform](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/germany-energy-analytics-platform)**  
   End-to-end analytics on German energy/public data with time-series-style analysis and dashboards – a good example of my BI and analytical storytelling.

4. **[Heart Disease Prediction (M.Sc. Thesis)](https://github.com/herrdevarsh/heart-disease-prediction-thesis)**  
   Full ML pipeline on clinical data: EDA, feature engineering, model comparison (ML + deep learning) and explainable AI (SHAP, LIME). Includes an “At a glance (for reviewers/recruiters)” section for a fast overview.

Each repo README explains:
- the **business / use case**
- the **architecture / approach**
- the **tech stack**
- how to **run it locally**
